    "\n",
    "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together;\n",
    "\n",
    "2)12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II;\n",
    "\n",
    "3)27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.\n",

    "[Special handling]\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest digits from left to right. However, we have two special handling for number 4 and number 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)The numeral of 4 is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)The same principle applies to the numeral of 9, which is written as IX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "I can placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.\n",
    "\n",
    "C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n",
